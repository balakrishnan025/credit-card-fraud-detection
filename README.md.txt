# Credit Card Fraud Detection (Data Science and Machine Learning Project)

This project uses the Kaggle "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset to build simple machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) that classify transactions as normal (0) or fraud (1).

## Dataset

- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud  
- The dataset is **not** included in this repository.  
- Download `creditcard.csv` from Kaggle and place it in the same folder as the notebook before running.  

## How to Run

1. Install Python and these packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `jupyter`.
2. Download `creditcard.csv` from Kaggle and put it next to the notebook.
3. Start Jupyter with `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb` and run all cells.
